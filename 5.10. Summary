That's it for the hard-core object trickery. You'll see a real-world application of special class methods in Chapter 12, which uses getattr to create a proxy to a remote web service.

The next chapter will continue using this code sample to explore other Python concepts, such as exceptions, file objects, and for loops.

Before diving into the next chapter, make sure you're comfortable doing all of these things:

Importing modules using either import module or from module import
Defining and instantiating classes
Defining __init__ methods and other special class methods, and understanding when they are called
Subclassing UserDict to define classes that act like dictionaries
Defining data attributes and class attributes, and understanding the differences between them
Defining private attributes and methods
